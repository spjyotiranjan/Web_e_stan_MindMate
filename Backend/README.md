Sample Request Body
```json
{
  "inputProblem": "I have been feeling overwhelmed with anxiety and stress due to increasing workload and expectations at my job. I constantly feel pressured to meet deadlines, and even when I am not working, my mind keeps racing with worries about pending tasks. This has been affecting my sleep, as I often stay awake overthinking or wake up feeling restless. Additionally, I have been struggling with social interactions, as I feel disconnected from friends and find it difficult to engage in conversations. I also experience occasional panic attacks, where my heart races, and I feel short of breath. These feelings have been persistent for several months, and I am finding it hard to cope.",
